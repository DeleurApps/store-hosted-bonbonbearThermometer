# Corona Store Submission

Thank you for submitting your plugin to the Corona Store!

## Warning: Update Schedule

This repository is synced every 10 minutes with the repository at Corona Labs. Every hour, plugin updates are sent to an Amazon server, which the build servers and simulator pulls from. This means it can take up to an hour for changes locally to show up for plugin users.
